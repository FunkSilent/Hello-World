Hello World,especially 'Internet world'.

This is the 26th year since I've been in the world. Life always be planned by others, like teachers,parents,managers and so on. Everything seems to be boring, so I go to the Games,friends,Internet to get the things most important --  freedom. Finally I found it's not belong to others, but always in one's heart in silence.

Hello world!!!
